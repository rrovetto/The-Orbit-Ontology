# The Orbit Ontology
An ontology of types of orbits in outer space, i.e., the orbits of astronomy and spaceflight.

_Alternative names_: The Orbit Type Ontology, The Gravitational Orbit Ontology, The Gravitaitonal Orbit Type Ontology, The Astronomical Orbit Ontology, The Astronomical Orbit Type Ontology, The Celestial Orbit Ontology, ...

## Description
_See also the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (purchase link coming soon)._

### Scope
The ontology captures concepts of astronomical orbits, their characteristics, and ways to classify them. It provides various categories for orbits, along various dimensions of categoriztion, such as orbital elements and other quantities.  

### Purpose
* To formally represent

### Architecture
A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider [space domain knowledge modeling](https://purl.org/space-ontology) suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).
